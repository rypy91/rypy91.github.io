							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>I am a geophysicist who investigates hydrogeologic systems hidden beneath oceans and ice sheets. I characterize the distribution and salinity of offshore and subglacial groundwater reservoirs in order to understand the interconnected hydrogeologic, climatic, and oceanographic forces that both influence and are influenced by groundwater.</p>
                            <p>I primarily use marine and polar electromagnetic methods to image the groundwater systems I seek to understand. I integrate geochemical, geological, and other geophysical datasets to develop holistic, integrated interpretations. </p>
                            <p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>

											<!--<h3>Geophysical Habitat of Subglacial Thwaites (GHOST)</h3>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/itgc_logo.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently a post doctoral researcher on the GHOST team of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC). This project will combine seismic, radar, magnetotelluric, ApRES, GPS, and gravity surveying to characterize the subglacial environment beneath Thwaites Glacier in order to better understand the potential for rapid collapse or retreat of the glacier. My primary role is to collect, process,  analyze, and interpret magnetotelluric data to investigate hydrgeologic and geothermal variations beneath Thwaites. Data collection is scheduled to start in 2022. More information about the GHOST project may be found <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org/projects/ghost">here</a>.

											<h3>SALSA EM </h3>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/salsa_em.jpg" alt="" /></span>SALSA EM is an electromagnetic geophysical investigation of groundwater beneath Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica. During the austral summer of 2018/2019, we collected magnetotelluric surveys over an active subglacial lake, Whillans Subglacial Lake (SLW), and the Whillans Grounding Zone (WGZ), where the waters from SLW are modeled to drain into the Southern Ocean. We imaged thick (>1km) sediments that contain salty groundwater, which has implications for basal hydrologic budgets, deep subglacial life, and past ice sheet conditions. This work is in preperation for publication. Results from this work may be found in chapters 3 - 6 of my <a href="https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-d3p7-k583">PhD Dissertation</a>. The website for this project can be found <a href="https://emlab.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.php/projects/subglacial-em-mapping/">here</a>.</p>
                                            
                                            <h3>Offshore Freshwater on the US Atlantic Coast</h3>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/freshwater2.jpg" alt="" /></span>In 2015, we collected marine controlled source electomagnetic (CSEM) and magnetotelluric data offshore the US Atlantic margin in order to map fresh groudwater contained within the contintental shelf sediments. Offshore both New Jersey and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, we found relatively fresh groundwater extends from the coast out to 90 km offshore. We estimate there is ~2800 km<sup>3</sup> of low-salinity offshore groundwater between New Jersey and Martha's Vineyard. This work is published in Scientific Reports and can be found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44611-7">here</a>. The website for this project can be found <a href="https://emlab.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.php/projects/freshwater/">here</a>.
